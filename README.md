# expressServer
To run the Express.js server, you need to follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org

2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using the command line or terminal.

3. Create a new file, let's say `server.ts`, and copy the provided code into that file.

4. Open the command line or terminal and navigate to the directory where you created the `server.ts` file.

5. Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies (Express.js and TypeScript):

   ```
   npm install express typescript
   ```

6. Once the dependencies are installed, you can compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript using the following command:

   ```
   npx tsc server.ts
   ```

   This command will generate a compiled JavaScript file named `server.js` based on your TypeScript code.

7. Finally, you can run the server by executing the following command:

   ```
   node server.js
   ```

   This will start the Express.js server, and you should see the message "Server started on port 3000" in the console.

8. You can now access your server by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the "Hello, World!" message when accessing the home page and other routes defined in your code.

Note: If you make any changes to the `server.ts` file, you need to recompile it using `npx tsc server.ts` and restart the server using `node server.js` to see the changes reflected.

The provided code is an example of a basic Express.js server written in TypeScript. Let's go through the code step by step to understand what each part does:

```typescript
import * as express from 'express';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
```

These lines import the Express.js module and the `Request` and `Response` types from the Express.js library. The `import * as express` line imports the entire Express.js module and assigns it to the `express` variable.

```typescript
const app = express();
```

This creates an instance of the Express.js application by calling the `express()` function. The `app` variable represents our Express.js application.

```typescript
app.use((req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) => {
  console.log('Request received at:', new Date().toISOString());
  next();
});
```

This line sets up a middleware function using the `use` method of the Express.js application. The middleware function takes three parameters: `req` (the request object), `res` (the response object), and `next` (a callback function). In this case, the middleware logs the received request time to the console and then calls the `next` function to pass control to the next middleware or route handler.

```typescript
app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
```

This sets up a route for the home page (the root path '/'). The route is registered using the `get` method of the Express.js application. When a GET request is made to the home page, the provided callback function is executed. In this case, the callback function sends the response 'Hello, World!' back to the client.

```typescript
app.get('/about', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('This is the About page');
});
```

This sets up another route for the '/about' path. Similarly to the previous example, when a GET request is made to this path, the provided callback function is executed. The callback function sends the response 'This is the About page' back to the client.

```typescript
app.get('/users', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  // Simulated data
  const users = [
    { id: 1, name: 'John' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Jane' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Bob' },
  ];

  res.json(users);
});
```

This sets up a route for the '/users' path. When a GET request is made to this path, the provided callback function is executed. In this case, the callback function creates a simulated array of users and sends it back to the client as JSON.

```typescript
app.get('/users/:id', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // Simulated data
  const user = { id: userId, name: 'User ' + userId };

  res.json(user);
});
```

This sets up a dynamic route for the '/users/:id' path. The ':id' part in the path indicates a parameter that can be extracted from the request URL. When a GET request is made to a path like '/users/1' or '/users/2', the provided callback function is executed. The callback function extracts the user ID from the URL parameters and creates a simulated user object based on that ID. The user object is then sent back to the client as JSON.

```typescript
app.use((err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) => {
  console.error('Error:', err);
